        <p> Hi there, my name is Ockert Buys and this is my personal webpage. <br>
            I am 26 years old and I live in Polokwane, Limpopo, South Africa. <br>
            <br>
            I have been working in Customer Service at a major bank in South Africa for about four years now, <br>
            and I am looking for a career change. <br>
            I have always had passion for technology and creating things from nothing. <br>
            I have done some woodwork and metalwork in the past and I find it almost <br>
            as satisfying as creating a program or webpage from just code. <br>
            <br>

            my career from pure Banking to Software Development in Banking. This webpage is one of the tasks I have to complete<br>
